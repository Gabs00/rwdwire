I had tried a number of existing plugins, but decided to try and make a smaller, simpler one.\n\nI started using canvas, then switched to CSS gradients, since it turned out to be easier to manage, and provided better cross browser support.\n\nSpectrum is registered as a jQuery plugin on the jQuery plugin repository here: http://plugins.jquery.com/spectrum/\n",
